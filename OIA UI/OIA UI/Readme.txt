SPE-Domain-1  ( Avg of sub1 +  Avg of sub2 +  Avg of sub3 + ...  / Total no. of sub )


Avg 0f subdom = ( Total of observed rating / No of Audits)


Avg 0f Subdom 1 = Mean value of subdom1 observed rating / Total no. of audits of subdom1
		= [(1+2+1+0+NA+1) / 5 ]  => Here is one audit is NA so sub 1 from total no. of aud
		= 5 / 5
		= 1

Avg 0f Subdom 2 = Mean value of subdom2 observed rating / Total no. of audits of subdom1
		= [(1+2+1+0+1+1) / 6 ]
		= 6 / 5
		= 1.2
Avg 0f Subdom 3 = Mean value of subdom3 observed rating / Total no. of audits of subdom1
		= [(1+2+1+0+1+1) / 6 ]
		= 6 / 5
		= 1.2

SPE-Domain-1 	= ( Avg of sub1 +  Avg of sub2 +  Avg of sub3 + ...  / Total no. of sub )
		= 1 + 1.2 + 1.2 / 3
		= 1.11
